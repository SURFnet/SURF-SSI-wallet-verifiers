## INTRODUCTION

To test with the eduID Wallet, 3 IRMA verifiers were deployed, based on SimpleSAMLphp and the IRMA server software.

For the demos, 2 domains were deployed, where one points directly at the php based applications, and one acts as a proxy for teh backend IRMA server component.

The code provided here contains the apache configurations, the simplesamlphp deploy configured for the domains and the 3 verifiers, and some subdirectories that represent 3 different verifier configurations (Pizza, EY and SURFspot), in accordance with the use cases tested at the demo.

## PREREQUISITES
To use these scripts you need to install the IRMA server, an apache webserver, SimpleSAMLphp and the authIRMA Simpelsamlphp module.
